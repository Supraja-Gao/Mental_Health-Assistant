# Mental_Health-Assistant
Built a web-based application that supports mental well-being through diary-based sentiment analysis, quiz-based psychometric profiling, and an AI-powered chatbot. Developed the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrated FastAPI for backend APIs, and used the Mistral-7B model for empathetic, context-aware conversations.
